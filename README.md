# Angular Product App

This project contains an Angular example that consumes a REST API for products and displays them using Angular Material tables.

## Development server

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app assumes the API endpoints `/api/productos` are available from the same origin.
